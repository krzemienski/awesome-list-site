# Awesome Video Resource Viewer

## Overview

A production-ready React application for browsing and discovering over 2,000 curated video development resources from the `krzemienski/awesome-video` GitHub repository. The project aims to provide a modern, mobile-optimized user interface with advanced search and filtering capabilities, dark theme support, and Google Analytics tracking. Future ambitions include transforming it into an AI-powered learning platform with user authentication, personalized recommendations, structured learning paths, an admin panel, and bidirectional GitHub synchronization for `awesome-list` repositories.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application employs a client-server architecture. The frontend is a React-based single-page application built with Vite, utilizing `shadcn/ui` components, Tailwind CSS, and React Query for data fetching. The backend is an Express.js server providing RESTful API endpoints. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM, with a defined schema for resources, categories, and subcategories.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Pure black cyberpunk theme**: Dark mode only, using OKLCH color space with vivid neon accents (pink primary, cyan accent). No shadows, no rounded corners, pure terminal aesthetic.
- JetBrains Mono monospace font used throughout.
- Zero border-radius enforced (`--radius: 0rem`).
- Mobile-optimized responsive design with WCAG AAA compliant 44x44px touch targets and a collapsible hierarchical sidebar.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, `shadcn/ui`, React Query for state management, Wouter for routing.
- **Backend**: Express.js, Drizzle ORM, Node Fetch for external data, Remark for Markdown parsing.
- **Data Architecture**: Pure JSON-driven parser for dynamic hierarchy building, supporting a 3-level hierarchical structure. Resources are categorized uniquely at their deepest level, with parent categories aggregating counts. Intelligent content-based auto-categorization is implemented for resources lacking specific subcategory IDs.
- **Sidebar Layout**: CSS Grid-based layout on desktop (`grid-cols-[var(--sidebar-width)_1fr]`), dynamically adjusting when collapsed.
- **Deployment**: Configured for deployment on Replit, with optimized production builds and static site generation.

### Feature Specifications
- **Search & Discovery**: Advanced fuzzy search across all resources with keyboard shortcut (⌘K), powered by Fuse.js.
- **AI Recommendations**: Personalized resource recommendations based on user profiles, skill levels, and learning goals (planned).
- **User Preferences**: Comprehensive preference management for learning (planned).
- **Color Customization**: Interactive color palette generator (planned).
- **Advanced Features**: Dedicated admin page with tabs for Resource Explorer, Analytics & Metrics, Data Export, and AI Recommendations.
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: 3-level category structure with accurate aggregated resource counts.
- **Authentication System**: Supports dual authentication via Replit Auth (GitHub, Google, Apple, X) and local email/password for development/admin, with secure session management and bcrypt hashing.
- **GitHub Integration**: Implemented GitHub import system for fetching raw resource URLs from public repositories, and an export system leveraging Replit GitHub OAuth to commit `awesome-lint` compliant markdown directly to GitHub.
- **Batch Enrichment System**: Claude AI integration for automated metadata extraction from resources. Features include sequential processing with configurable batch sizes, rate limiting, smart URL validation, retry logic, accurate tracking, and a dedicated admin UI for monitoring and control. Integrated web scraping extracts page metadata (title, description, Open Graph images, Twitter Cards, favicon) using Cheerio with proper error handling for missing meta tags.
