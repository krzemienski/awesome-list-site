### Run15 Publish + Prod Data Fixes (July 17, 2026)
- **Run15 build republished** (verified live via masked CSV export). Prod data fixes applied through the live admin API via new `scripts/run15-data-fixes-prod.ts` (prod DB is not agent-writable): BUG-009 both entity rows decoded; BUG-046 node 3712 → "Podcasts" + resource 185847 repointed. Journal: `evidence/run15/data-fixes-prod.json`.
- **Watchdog extended**: `github_sync_queue` rows `pending` for >7 days are now swept to failed (boot + periodic) — the 16 prod rows stuck since Nov 2025 clear automatically on the NEXT republish (the 5-min sweep deliberately never touches `pending`, and no admin endpoint can fail queue rows).

### Black-Box Audit Remediation — Run15 (July 17, 2026)
- **50-finding MASTER-FIX-PROMPT audit triaged live** (BUG-001..050): 27 fixed + 1 fixed-prior (BUG-025), 13 invalid, 2 data-fix (BUG-009 entity-unescape / BUG-046 duplicate node — journaled, prod rerun pending), 1 platform (BUG-038 edge appends `:443`), 1 user-action (BUG-020 www DNS), 1 by-design (BUG-050 public theme picker), 1 declined (BUG-021). Full table: `evidence/run15/findings-table.md`.
- **Notable: BUG-011 orphan-job watchdog** — startup sweep + 5-min periodic sweep flips stuck `pending`/`processing` enrichment + GitHub-sync rows to failed. Architect blocker fixed: the periodic sweep now EXCLUDES jobs owned by live in-process workers (`enrichmentService.getActiveJobIds()` + `syncService.getActiveQueueIds()` registries) because `startedAt` is written once and real enrichment runs exceed 5 min — age-only sweeping would falsely fail them. Probe: `evidence/run15/bug-011-watchdog-exclusion-probe.txt` (owned rows survive; unowned stale rows still flip).
- **Verified** (Iron Rule): tsc clean; suites green — API 10/10, desktop 11/11 + 9/9, auth 5/5 + 7/7, mobile@375 4/4, BUG-045 tablet@768 probe; P0 smoke 12/12; migration-drift clean; QA teardown residue 0 (probe rows + 5 `__qa_test` users removed).
- **Needs republish. Prod follow-ups after republish**: rerun `scripts/run15-data-fixes.ts` (BUG-009/011/046); user adds `www` CNAME (BUG-020); dedupe `lower(email)` collisions + add unique functional index on `users(lower(email))`.

## Design-System scope (MR-DS-13)

The Awesome.Video DS contract documented in `docs/` + `HANDOFF.md` is implemented with three intentional, in-repo divergences from the canonical handoff. Every future Stage-5/Stage-6 DS sweep should treat these as architectural decisions, not per-occurrence violations:

1. **shadcn/ui primitives replace raw `.btn / .card / .chip / .input`.** The runtime surfaces use `Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, `Input` (and other shadcn primitives) styled through the `client/src/index.css @theme inline` bridge that maps `--color-*` shadcn tokens onto DS tokens (`--accent`, `--bg`, `--surface`, etc.). Searching the DOM for stray `<button>` outside `.btn/.tab/.icon-btn` is expected to return many — that is shadcn working as designed. Class-compliance audits (DS Stage 6) should compare against the shadcn-bridge surface, not the raw handoff classes.
2. **Body-level atmosphere + `.page contents` wrapper.** The `--bg-atmosphere` gradient is painted on `body` (handoff parity), and `MainLayout` wraps the chrome subtree in `<div className="page contents">` so the DS structural-class contract is satisfied without disturbing the `SidebarProvider` flex layout. The `contents` utility suppresses `.page`'s own box, so its container visuals (`position: relative`, min-height, background) are inert — atmosphere continues to come from body-level rules. If a future DS pass needs `.page` container visuals to take effect, drop the `contents` utility and re-verify the flex/peer chain.
3. **Full 5-system × 10-accent runtime switcher (May 23, 2026 — replaces prior single-personality build).** All five system skins (Editorial / Terminal / Geist / Brutalist / Swiss) are live and switchable at runtime via the picker at `/settings/theme`. Token application is CSS-attribute-driven: per-system token blocks live as `:root[data-system="..."]` selectors in `design-system.css`, and per-accent overrides live as `:root[data-accent="..."]` blocks. `applyDesignSystem(systemId, accentId)` (in `client/src/lib/design-system.ts`) only toggles the two attributes on `<html>` + persists to `localStorage` (keys `ds-system`, `ds-accent`) — no inline style writes. The `client/index.html` boot script reads both keys pre-paint and applies them before any module runs, so personality swap is FOUC-free. Default: Editorial + Crimson. Accent default per system follows the handoff's `SYSTEM_DEFAULT_ACCENT` map (editorial→crimson, terminal→matrix, geist→cyan, brutalist→amber, swiss→orange) — if the user is on a system's natural default and switches systems, the accent nudges to the new system's natural default; otherwise the explicit accent choice carries across.

### Canonical shadcn ↔ DS class mapping

| Handoff DS class | Runtime equivalent |
|---|---|
| `.btn` / `.btn.primary` / `.btn.ghost` / `.btn.icon` | `<Button variant="default|secondary|ghost|outline" />` |
| `.card` / `.card.hoverable` / `.card.glow` | `<Card />` (+ tailwind `hover:` / shadow utilities) |
| `.chip` / `.chip.accent` / `.chip.ok` / `.chip.warn` / `.chip.bad` | `<Badge variant="default|secondary|destructive|outline" />` (status variants extended ad-hoc) |
| `.input` / `.select` / `.textarea` | `<Input />` / `<Select />` / `<Textarea />` |
| `.eyebrow` | `.eyebrow` (kept literal — shadcn has no eyebrow primitive) |
| `.kbd` | `<kbd className="…" />` (kept literal — shadcn has no kbd primitive) |
| `.tabs` / `.tab` | `<Tabs />` / `<TabsTrigger />` |
| `.table` | `<Table />` (data tables only — admin/analytics surfaces) |

### Chart palette source of truth

All recharts strokes/fills route through `client/src/lib/charts/palette.ts` (`CHART_PALETTE`). The 10-slot palette mirrors DS accents (`--accent`, `--accent-2`) + DS status semantics (`#34d08c`, `#ff5c7a`, `#ffb84d`, `#5eddf2`, `#9d4edd`) verbatim from `design-system.css`. Per-recharts component literals are intentional — recharts cannot read CSS vars from prop strings — and are tagged `/* DS-OK: ... */` where they appear.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application employs a client-server architecture. The frontend is a React-based single-page application built with Vite, utilizing `shadcn/ui` components, Tailwind CSS, and React Query for data fetching. The backend is an Express.js server providing RESTful API endpoints. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM, with a defined schema for resources, categories, and subcategories.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Pure black cyberpunk theme**: Dark mode only, using OKLCH color space with vivid neon accents (pink primary, cyan accent). No shadows, no rounded corners, pure terminal aesthetic.
- JetBrains Mono monospace font used throughout.
- Zero border-radius enforced (`--radius: 0rem`).
- Mobile-optimized responsive design with WCAG AAA compliant 44x44px touch targets and a collapsible hierarchical sidebar.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, `shadcn/ui`, React Query for state management, Wouter for routing.
- **Backend**: Express.js, Drizzle ORM, Node Fetch for external data, Remark for Markdown parsing.
- **Data Architecture**: PostgreSQL database serves as single source of truth. `getAwesomeListFromDatabase()` method builds complete hierarchical structure from database tables (categories → subcategories → sub-subcategories with LEFT JOINs). Supports 3-level hierarchy with accurate resource counts at each level.
- **Sidebar Layout**: CSS Grid-based layout on desktop (`grid-cols-[var(--sidebar-width)_1fr]`), dynamically adjusting when collapsed.
- **Deployment**: Configured for deployment on Replit, with optimized production builds. Database must be seeded for production (`/api/admin/seed-database`).

### Feature Specifications
- **Search & Discovery**: Advanced fuzzy search across all resources with keyboard shortcut (⌘K), powered by Fuse.js.
- **AI Recommendations**: Personalized resource recommendations based on user profiles, skill levels, and learning goals (planned).
- **Authentication System**: Supports dual authentication via Replit Auth (GitHub, Google, Apple, X) and local email/password for development/admin, with secure session management and bcrypt hashing.
- **GitHub Integration**: Implemented GitHub import system for fetching raw resource URLs from public repositories, and an export system leveraging Replit GitHub OAuth to commit `awesome-lint` compliant markdown directly to GitHub.
- **Batch Enrichment System**: Claude AI integration for automated metadata extraction from resources. Features include sequential processing with configurable batch sizes, rate limiting, smart URL validation, retry logic, accurate tracking, and a dedicated admin UI for monitoring and control. Integrated web scraping extracts page metadata (title, description, Open Graph images, Twitter Cards, favicon) using Cheerio with proper error handling for missing meta tags.
