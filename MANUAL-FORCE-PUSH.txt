The deployment system is now fully functional with git-safe mode.

git add .

# 3. Commit the deployment fixes
git commit -m "Fix deployment system: implement git-safe mode and comprehensive error handling

- Added git-safe deployment mode to handle repository conflicts

# 4. Force push to main
git push --force-with-lease origin main
