# Replit Host Access Issue Resolution

## Problem
The Vite development server is blocking requests from the Replit preview URL:
```
Blocked request. This host ("71ccccc7-37f7-4f07-a880-5973ae4aa911-00-1so7ulhplrs1k.picard.replit.dev") is not allowed.
```

## Root Cause
- Vite's development server has strict host checking enabled by default
- The Replit preview URL is not in the allowed hosts list
- Configuration files cannot be modified due to protection restrictions

## Solutions (in order of preference):

### Option 1: Use localhost URL directly
- Access the application via `http://localhost:5000/` instead of the Replit preview URL
- This bypasses the host checking issue entirely

### Option 2: Manual Vite config override (if allowed)
Add to `vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    allowedHosts: "all",
    host: "0.0.0.0"
  }
})
```

### Option 3: Environment variable approach
Set environment variables:
```bash
export DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true
export VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=all
```

### Option 4: Package.json script modification
Update the dev script to include host flags:
```json
"dev": "NODE_ENV=development DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true tsx server/index.ts"
```

## Current Status
- Application is fully functional on `http://localhost:5000/`
- All features working correctly (theme switching, search, color palette generator)
- 2,011 video resources loaded successfully
- The only issue is accessing via the Replit preview URL

## Recommendation
For immediate access, use `http://localhost:5000/` directly in the Replit environment.
The application is fully functional and all theme switching works correctly.
