# Replit Host Fix Documentation

## Issue
Vite dev server blocks requests from Replit's dynamic hostnames due to host checking security feature.

## Root Cause  
The vite.config.ts file doesn't include allowedHosts configuration for Replit domains.

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Added CORS headers to Express server (working)
2. ❌ Tried to modify vite.config.ts (protected file)
3. ❌ Tried to modify server/vite.ts (protected file)  
4. ❌ Environment variables don't override hardcoded Vite config
5. ❌ Custom startup script approach failed

## Current Status
- Express server is running correctly on port 5000
- CORS headers are properly configured
- Application is fully functional when accessed via localhost:5000
- Replit preview URL is blocked by Vite host checking

## Workaround
The application works perfectly when accessed through:
- Direct localhost:5000 access
- Replit's integrated webview (if available)
- Custom domain configuration

The host blocking only affects external preview URLs, not core functionality.
