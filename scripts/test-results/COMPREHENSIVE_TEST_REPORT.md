## Testing Methodology

This report was generated using API-based testing methodology:

1. **API Testing**: Direct HTTP requests to test endpoints
2. **Data Analysis**: Processing and validation of returned data
3. **Performance Measurement**: Timing of API calls and data operations
4. **Logic Verification**: Testing search, filter, and sort algorithms

Note: UI-specific features (layout switching, visual components) require browser-based testing for complete verification.

## Next Steps

1. Address any failing tests
2. Implement recommended optimizations
3. Conduct browser-based UI testing for visual features
4. Perform user acceptance testing
5. Monitor performance in production environment
